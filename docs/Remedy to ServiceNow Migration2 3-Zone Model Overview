Remedy to ServiceNow Migration: 3-Zone Model Overview
This document explains the high-level migration path from SRXML Remedy exports into ServiceNow. It breaks the process into three zones to clarify how data flows and where each transformation occurs.
ZONE A: SOURCE – Remedy (SRXML/XML)
- Raw data exported by Dan (SRXML, SQL dump, attachments)
- Examples: TSR_Email_Doc.srxml, base64 docs, attachment metadata
- Output Format: SRXML/XML/CSV
ZONE B: TRANSFORMATION – ETL + Import Set
- Scripts (Python/PowerShell) parse SRXML and extract values
- Import Set table stores staged XML payload
- Transform Maps match fields (e.g., TSR Title → Short Description)
- Adam’s script/UI Action may be used to parse/convert DOC fields
ZONE C: DESTINATION – Final ServiceNow Table
- Target: u_tsr_requests, cmdb_ci_computer, sc_req_item, etc.
- Attachments linked using DocID
- Records become visible to users/agents in ServiceNow UI
- Verified post-import for data integrity and completeness
Example Flow (Diagram):
ZONE A           -->         ZONE B               -->         ZONE C
SRXML Export     -->   Import Set + Transform     -->   Final SN Table
                  (staging table + script)             (e.g., u_tsr_requests)
Pending / Notes:
- Still need access to: x_g_dis_dmp_order_tsr_list.do (denied currently)
- Clarify if that table reflects post-transform RITM/Order data
Closing Statement:
Let me know where this pipeline can be clarified or streamlined. I'm happy to adjust mappings or add more visibility into the transform layer if needed.
